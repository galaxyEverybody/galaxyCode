<h2 style="margin-top:50px;">Tasks (ToDo list)</h2>

<p>The ToDo list has two parts – active tasks and archive.<br />
In both parts, the user can all tasks of projects where he/it is registered from the project - as well as management sees. Gave up with the labeling “private” is visible only for the owners, i.e. from whom this task was produced.</p>

<h3>Editor</h3>

<p>Each task has a name (title) and must be assigned to a certain project. For better control, the scheduling serves with the duty-field “start” (from when this task is to be taken care of) and optionally field “end”, until when this task is to be taken care of. However the statement of the scheduling has an effect on the status-ad and does the whole work with it much clearer.</p>

<p>Furthermore, each task must contain a priority. Besides his/its direct meaning, this field can be used also for other purposes. This field cannot only digits as an exception but also all others mark contains. Her/it/them can assign with it this field special functionality, for example ‚D' –for development ‚MG' –for the management etc.</p>

<p>The task functionality underbid made become a user the tasks generated by other persons to the own. Also the check box therefore becomes „private “, to fade these of other users only with the tasks produced themselves indicated with the possibility. That is meaningfully if they would clearly like to hold the task-list for all participants with smaller personal tasks. One must heed on this position that even „private “tasks independently from the status, takes care of–doesn't take care of, the clasp of the project of the project-management prevents. In this case, all tasks should be postponed manually to the project of respective co-workers into the archive.</p>

<p><a name="warn">“Warning for course-date”</a> has only one effect, if the optionally field “end” the date was written down. For example, if 1 day stands in the field, then a yellow blinking symbol will appear 1 days of the end-date in the status-strip which shall statements: “Warning! The time for this task runs out soon!”.</p>

<p>For the better clearness, also that is used “degree-of-completion”. The percent data is estimated subjectively by co-workers and is written down. In the corresponding column, the task-list shows the completion-of-degree with green beams.</p>

<p>If the task is completed, one must the check box “Compl.” in the editor-mask or clicks directly in the list, rows “Compl.” or “Status”. If the chosen task is completed, it becomes after the attic “crossed out”.</p>

<p>The field “commentary” can serve also as history for this task for the involved collaborator.</p>

<p>The tasks from the group “currently” cannot become erased directly; they are first postponed into the archive.  Only in the archive, if it should necessarily be, undesirable tasks can become erased.</p>

<p>The click on the green cross-symbol prepares the input-mask for a new task. If one clicks on an existing task, she/it is loaded into the input-mask.</p>

<h3>ToDo-list</h3>
<img src="images/pt-BR/todolist.png"  style="float:left; margin-right:20px;" alt="ToDo-list" />
<p>For a better clearness, the task-list shows 50 entries per page. Furthermore, the list reduces “Search”, “Prio.”, tasks and projects itself filters.<br />
With the mouse-click on the labeling-strip in the task-list you can sort column.</p>

<p>The click on the check box in the column “Compl.” or “Status” does selected task as completed, crossed out, and turned back. The changes-date for this task is changed in accordance with each time.</p>

<p>The click on all cells in the list besides “Compl.”, “Status” and “degree-of-completion” loads this task into the editor-mask for the editing.</p>

<p>The click on the column completion-degree recovers this about 25% upward. After the reached degree in 100%, the completion-degree is put back on 0% again etc.</p>

The status-column can contain following symbols:
<ul>
<li>Green – the task runs normally after the schedule (more than 0% degree-of-completion)</li>
<li>Yellow – the time for this task after the schedule already runs, however it was still made for nothing.</li>
<li>Yellow blinking – the time for these runs soon (see <a href="#warn">“warning for course-date”</a>)</li>
<li>Red – the time for this task is expired.</li>
<li>Blue – the time for this task is not yet started.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Archive</h3>

<P>The archive is similarly built, however without the possibility for the additional treatment of tasks. They should postpone this task for it with the click till the symbol with the table and the arrow into the list with current tasks and should only process after it there also in already known way.</p>

<p>The click on the trash can-symbol deletes the task irrevocably.</p>
