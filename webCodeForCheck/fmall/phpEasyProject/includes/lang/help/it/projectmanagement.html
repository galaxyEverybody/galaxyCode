<h2 style="margin-top:50px;">Project Management</h2>

<p>The Project Management as module is for the users with the position “project manager” and “store manager” accessible. Those see with it “project manager” only the projects, where they have been written down as participants. The “store manager” sees all project.</p>

<p>The editor-mask for the projects consists of the duty-field “project name” and optionally commentary. The check box “Active project” shows in the clicked condition in the opposite to the todo list the committee (valid) projects.</p>

<p>Under the commentary stand a list with the members of project against each other in each case and a list with remaining members. The allocation from members to the project or turned back happened through the double click on the respective name in the list.</p>

<p>If a co-worker should be withdrawn from the list, this becomes also no tasks (inclusive themselves produced) to this project no longer sees.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:50px;">Project - Position</h2>

<p>Each project have several project-positions or sub-projects normally, very often with multiple levels as sub-positions. With the mouse-click on the symbol <img src="images/activity.png"  alt="project position" /> right in the project-list lands itself one in the list with the project-positions to the selected project (link above left for the transition back to the project-list).</p>

<p>The administration of project-positions works very similarly like with the project-administration with the difference that the project-positions in the tree-structure can become ordered according to order at will “After selected position” item or “As underposition”.</p>

<p>Altering of statuses of the project-position is used as visual piece of information for the project-course and does no effect in this version of phpEasyProject for example the activity-recording.</p>
